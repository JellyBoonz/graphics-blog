# About Jelly Renders

Welcome to my corner of the internet dedicated to computer graphics, rendering, and the mathematics that makes it all possible.

This blog is a collection of thoughts, demonstrations, and explorations in computer graphics. I write about **rendering techniques**, **math**, and other related stuff.

## Why Graphics Programming?

Computer graphics sits at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and visual art. It's a field where:

- **Theory meets practice**: Beautiful mathematical concepts become stunning visual results
- **Performance matters**: Every nanosecond counts in real-time applications
- **Innovation thrives**: New algorithms and techniques are constantly being developed

The journey from understanding a mathematical concept to seeing it rendered on screen is incredibly rewarding (as well as challenging). This blog documents that journey.
It's fun and hopefully this blog serves as way for you to try it.

## About me

I'm an *aspiring* graphics programmer interested in creating beautiful visual experiences with math.

When I'm not writing code or blog posts, you might find me:
- Reading fantasy novels
- Riding a bike
- Playing with my kids

## Technical Stack

This blog is built with:
- **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)**: Static site generator
- **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**: Hosting and deployment
- **[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)**: Mathematical notation rendering
- **Custom CSS**
