# About Jelly Renders

Welcome to my corner of the internet dedicated to computer graphics, rendering, and the mathematics that makes it all possible.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is a collection of thoughts, tutorials, and explorations in computer graphics. I write about:

### Rendering Techniques
- **Ray Tracing**: From basic ray-sphere intersections to advanced global illumination
- **Rasterization**: Traditional GPU rendering pipelines and optimizations
- **Real-time Graphics**: Techniques for achieving 60+ FPS in modern games and applications

### Mathematical Foundations
- **Linear Algebra**: Matrices, vectors, and transformations in graphics
- **Calculus**: Understanding derivatives and integrals in rendering contexts
- **Geometry**: 3D mathematics, coordinate systems, and spatial relationships

### Implementation Details
- **Code Examples**: Working implementations in C++, GLSL, and other languages
- **Performance Analysis**: Profiling and optimizing rendering algorithms
- **Best Practices**: Lessons learned from real-world graphics programming

## Why Graphics Programming?

Computer graphics sits at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and visual art. It's a field where:

- **Theory meets practice**: Beautiful mathematical concepts become stunning visual results
- **Performance matters**: Every nanosecond counts in real-time applications
- **Innovation thrives**: New algorithms and techniques are constantly being developed

The journey from understanding a mathematical concept to seeing it rendered on screen is incredibly rewarding. This blog documents that journey.

## About the Author

I'm a graphics programmer passionate about understanding how digital images are created. My background includes:

- Computer Science education with focus on graphics and mathematics
